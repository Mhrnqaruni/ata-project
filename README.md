## About This Project

ATA (Academic Teaching Assistant) is a comprehensive educational platform designed to streamline classroom management and enhance student engagement through interactive assessments and real-time quizzing. Built with a modern tech stack featuring FastAPI (Python) on the backend and React on the frontend, the platform enables teachers to create and manage classes, conduct live quiz sessions with automatic grading, track student performance through detailed analytics, and facilitate seamless student-teacher interactions. The quiz system supports multiple question types, real-time leaderboards, guest participation without requiring accounts, auto-advance functionality with configurable cooldowns, and time-limited questions to ensure fair assessment—all designed to make teaching more efficient and learning more engaging for K-12 and higher education environments.
